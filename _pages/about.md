I completed my PhD in Physics (2024) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) in the [Department of Chemical and Physical Sciences](https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/graduate/current-students/).

My research focused on stochastic biochemical networks, where I developed mathematical models to analyze the probability distributions generated by dynamical systems. My work combined mathematical techniques for analyzing stochastic systems, information theory, and numerical simulations to explore two key questions:
- How can cells control the intrinsic randomess of biochemical reactions?
- What is the relationship between variability and information in cells?

My current interests lie in applying my expertise in modelling stochastic processes to generative modeling, particularly diffusion models and flow-matching. I aim to develop methods to accelerate both training and inference, and better interpret the behaviour of these models.

I am always excited to discuss topics related to math and science (with a natural bias to the fields that I've worked in), so please feel free to reach out if you have any questions about my work!
