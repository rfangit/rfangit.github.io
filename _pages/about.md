I completed my PhD in Physics (2024) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) at the [Department of Chemical & Physical Sciences](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/cps/).

My research focused on stochastic biochemical networks, where I developed mathematical models to analyze the probability distributions generated by dynamical systems. I combined mathematical techniques for analyzing stochastic systems, information theory, and numerical simulations to explore two key questions:
- How can cells control the intrinsic randomess of biochemical reactions?
- What is the relationship between variability and information in cells?

My current interests lie in applying my expertise in modelling stochastic processes to generative modeling, particularly diffusion models and flow-matching. I aim to develop methods to accelerate both training and inference, and better interpret the behaviour of these models.

I am always excited to discuss topics related to math and science (with a natural bias to the fields that I've worked in), so please feel free to reach out if you have any questions about my work!
